<h3>Arting</h3>

Arting is a web application designed for creative professionals in Europe who are seeking new spaces to work, exhibit, or collaborate in. Our platform allows users to create listings for their own creative spaces and browse other users' listings to find suitable matches. Whether you are an artist looking for a studio, a curator seeking an exhibition space, or a designer looking for a workshop, Arting can help you find the perfect space.

To facilitate communication and negotiation between users, Arting includes an internal messaging system that allows users to exchange messages and arrange swaps with ease. We believe that by fostering a community of creative professionals, we can help facilitate new connections and collaborations that might not have been possible otherwise.

Our platform is currently focused on Europe, but we plan to expand to other regions in the near future. We are committed to making Arting a user-friendly and valuable tool for the creative community and welcome any feedback or suggestions from our users.
