<h1>Arting</h1>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

Arting is a web application designed for creative professionals in Europe who are seeking new spaces to work, exhibit, or collaborate in. Our platform allows users to create listings for their own creative spaces and browse other users' listings to find suitable matches. Whether you are an artist looking for a studio, a curator seeking an exhibition space, or a designer looking for a workshop, Arting can help you find the perfect space.

To facilitate communication and negotiation between users, Arting includes an internal messaging system that allows users to exchange messages and arrange swaps with ease. We believe that by fostering a community of creative professionals, we can help facilitate new connections and collaborations that might not have been possible otherwise.

Our platform is currently focused on Europe. We are committed to making Arting a user-friendly and valuable tool for the creative community and welcome any feedback or suggestions from our users.


<h3>Features</h3>

- Booking System: Arting has a user-friendly booking system that allows artists to easily search and book residencies with one another.
- Internal Credit: Arting uses an internal credit system that enables artists to trade credits for residencies, making the exchange process more efficient and secure.
- Messaging System: Arting's messaging system allows artists to communicate with one another directly within the platform, making it easy to coordinate and plan their residencies.
